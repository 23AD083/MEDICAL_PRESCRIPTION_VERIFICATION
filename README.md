PROBLEM STATEMENT:
TitleAI Medical Prescription Verification Leveraging IBM Watson and Hugging Face ModelsDescriptionThis
 project aims to analyze drug interactions, identify correct drug 
dosages, and provide safe alternative medication options based on age 
and drug details. It integrates multiple datasets and leverages advanced
 NLP models and APIs for accurate drug information extraction and 
interaction understanding. The system is built with a FastAPI backend 
and a Streamlit frontend for easy user interaction.Expected Solutions1)
 Drug Interaction Detection System – Detects and flags harmful 
interactions between multiple drugs entered by the user using integrated
 drug databases.

2) Age-Specific Dosage Recommendation – 
Recommends accurate dosages based on patient age and drug safety 
profiles, ensuring age-appropriate treatment.

3) Alternative 
Medication Suggestions – Suggests safer or equivalent drugs when 
interactions or contraindications are identified for a given patient 
profile.

4) NLP-Based Drug Information Extraction – Uses advanced
 NLP models to extract structured drug details (name, dosage, frequency)
 from unstructured medical text.

5) User-Friendly Interface ( 
Streamlit) – Provides an interactive frontend for users and a responsive
 backend for real-time drug analysis and recommendations.Technologies & Tools Python, Streamlit, IBM Watson, HuggingFace, Fast APIReferences
